# Attendance-Monitoring-and-Updating-System
A C++ program that manages student records within a class using a combination of arrays, structs, and a map data structure. The program offers various functionalities related to student information, attendance tracking, and record management.

the code's main features:

Data Structure Definition:
The program defines a struct named S to hold individual student information. Each student's details include their PRN (Personal Registration Number), name, date of birth (DOB), attendance for different subjects (DSA, DECO, DM, AM, OOP, HSMC), and email address.

Main Function:
The main() function is where the execution of the program begins. It sets up an array of struct S named data to hold student records, a map named M to store the student records, and an array att to store attendance values.

Menu-Driven Interface:
The program provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to perform various operations related to student records and attendance management. The available menu options are:

Adding a new student record.
Displaying all student records.
Updating student attendance.
Finding students with the highest attendance.
Generating a defaulter list for students with low attendance.
Displaying individual overall student attendance.
Displaying subject-wise individual student attendance.
Calculating overall class attendance.
Deleting student details.
Additional lectures for defaulter students.
Exiting the program.
Menu Functionality:
The program uses a switch statement to handle the selected menu option. Depending on the user's choice, the program performs actions such as:

Adding new student records.
Displaying existing student records.
Updating student attendance for specific subjects.
Finding students with the highest attendance and displaying their details.
Generating a list of students with attendance below a certain threshold.
Displaying individual overall student attendance.
Handling the other menu options accordingly.
User Interaction:
The program interacts with the user through input prompts, where the user can provide information such as PRN, name, date of birth, attendance for different subjects, and email address. It then processes the user's input to update or display relevant data.

Loop and Exit:
The program runs in an infinite loop that continues to display the menu options until the user chooses to exit (option 11). When the user decides to exit, the program displays a thank-you message and terminates.

Note:
While the code has the structure and functionalities outlined above, there are a few areas that might need attention and correction. For example, there are inconsistencies in updating attendance and handling menu options. Additionally, the code may require further validation and error handling to ensure robust functionality and prevent unexpected behavior.

Overall, this code serves as a basic framework for managing student records and attendance, but it would benefit from further refinement and testing to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
